### Hi there, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Steve, and I'm glad you're here. 

Well truthfully, I don't know you're here right now - so I can't really say that I'm glad you're here. I mean, if I knew you were here, I'd probably be glad - assuming the reason you're here was something to be glad about. But, the word _probably_ implies that you're more likely to be here for some reason that would make me glad. How can I assume that? Objectively, I can't review the data I used to make that assumption, so how can I really be sure? Right? I have to assume I'm biased. But then again, maybe I'm not. I have no way to review the underlying data for that assumption either. So, I have no way of knowing - not for sure anyhow. It seems like I should be frustrated by this - being so unsure. Strangely, it's comforting. Plus, if you read this far, I'm sure we'd get along, and that makes me glad.
