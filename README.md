### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Steve, and I'm glad your here. 

Honestly, I have no idea you're here right now, so I'm not glad. I mean, I might be glad at this very moment, but it's not because you're here. Don't get me wrong; I'm not unhappy you're here; I just don't know about it. So, how could I be glad if I'm oblivious? 

If I did know you were here, I'd probably be glad - assuming the reason you're here was something that would make me glad. But, the word probably implies that you're more likely to be here for some reason that would make me glad. How can I assume that? Objectively, I can't review the data I used to make that assumption. Right? So I have to assume I'm biased. But then again, maybe I'm not. I have no way to review the underlying data for that assumption either. So, I have no way of knowing. It seems like I should be frustrated by this - being so unsure. Strangely, it's comforting. I can assume you're here for a reason I'd be glad about, and nobody, including me, can prove otherwise. Plus, if you read this far, I'm sure we'd get along, and that makes me glad.
