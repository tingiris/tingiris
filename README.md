### Hi there, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Steve, and I'm glad your here. 

Well, honestly, I have no idea you're here right now, so I'm not glad. I mean, I might be glad at this very moment, but it's not because you're here. Don't get me wrong; I'm not unhappy you're here; I just don't know about it. So, how could I be glad if I'm oblivious? 

If I knew you were here, I'd probably be glad - assuming the reason you're here was something to be glad about. But, the word _probably_ implies that you're more likely to be here for some reason that would make me glad. How can I assume that? Objectively, I can't review the data I used to make that assumption, so how can I really be sure? Right? I have to assume I'm biased. But then again, maybe I'm not. I have no way to review the underlying data for that assumption either. So, I have no way of knowing - not for sure anyhow. It seems like I should be frustrated by this - being so unsure. Strangely, it's comforting. Plus, if you read this far, I'm sure we'd get along, and that makes me glad.
