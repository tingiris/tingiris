### Hi there, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Steve. 

Iâ€™m a software architect turned entrepreneur and author. I founded [Dabble Lab](https://dabblelab.com). Itâ€™s a multi-national collective of technology fanatics. We team up to help our clients automate things that humans shouldnâ€™t have to do. 

I also write books and create technical tutorials. In 2020 I wrote the book [Exploring GPT-3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1800563191). Itâ€™s done well and even became an Amazon bestseller. Iâ€™m proud of that because I grew up with a learning disability and couldnâ€™t read proficiently until I was an adult. So, I never imagined Iâ€™d be an author.

I love learning and I learn best by doing. I also learn fastest when I consider how to teach what Iâ€™m learning to someone else. Thatâ€™s mostly why [I create tutorials](https://youtube.com/dabblelab). Iâ€™ve created hundreds of them over the years. Some Iâ€™ve published but most I havenâ€™t

Iâ€™ve had 27 different jobs in my life. Most I hated or wasnâ€™t very good at. But I learned something from all of them. A few I really loved. My favorite jobs were:

- Managing a Little Caesars Pizza (despite being robbed twice)
- Working in the tennis department of a sporting goods store (but I donâ€™t play tennis)
- Bar backing at a club that hosted sand volleyball competitions (I met my wife there)
- Working as a software trainer at Kennedy Space Center (I got to work with actual rocket scientists)

I keep a list of questions that Iâ€™d like answers for in my lifetime. The list is over 150 pages long and growing. I add a lot more questions than answers. So the older I get the more questions I have.

I like street art on dilapidated buildings and bumper stickers on crappy old vehicles. The raw expression of creativity and ideas despite the format is inspiring to me. My favorite graffiti mural depicts a robot destroying a city. I saw it while traveling with my son in ReykjavÃ­k Iceland. I donâ€™t like the idea of robots destroying things but the colors and the composition of that mural I loved. My favorite bumper sticker was on a rusted old pick-up truck in rural Kentucky. It said, There is no place like 127.0.0.1. Before reading it I felt like a stranger in a strange land. Afterwards, I felt instantly at home.

I once put a live alligator into the trunk of my car. It had been hit by another car and I wanted to get it help. I learned that good intentions donâ€™t equal good ideas. I also learned some veterinarians donâ€™t consider helping large angry reptiles as something a veterinarian should be prepared for.

I didnâ€™t use ChatGPT to write this bio. I did try however. It just wasnâ€™t getting the alligator story right.
